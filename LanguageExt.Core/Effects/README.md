Effects are functorial, monadic, and applicative types that are designed to capture IO based side-effects.    

| Section              | Type                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`IO`](IO)           | [`IO<A>`](IO)                                 | Asynchronous and synchronous IO.  Captures side-effects, manages resources, but throws exceptions.  The `IO` monad is the base of all IO based operations and should be used in your monad-transformer stacks when you need IO. |
| [`Eff`](Eff)         | [`Eff<A>`](Eff)                               | Asynchronous and synchronous IO.  Captures side-effects, manages resources, handles exceptions elegantly.                                                                                                                       |
| [`Eff`](Eff)         | [`Eff<RT, A>`](Eff)                           | Asynchronous and synchronous IO.  Captures side-effects, manages resources, handles exceptions elegantly, and has an injectable runtime (`RT`) which can provide configuration and dependency-injection                         |
| [`StreamT`](StreamT) | [`StreamT<M, A>`](StreamT)                    | Lazy sequence monad transformer that can be used to stream effects synchronously or asynchronously.  Most useful when pared with IO monads, but can be pared with any monad `M`, to create a stream of `M` effects.             |
| [`Pipes`](Pipes)     | [`Proxy<RT, UOut, UIn, DIn, DOut, A>`](Pipes) | Base of all Pipes types - single type that unifies unidirectional bidirectional streaming channels.                                                                                                                             |
