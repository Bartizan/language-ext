/// Working with space-like structures, such as time and space, poses an interesting challenge. Spaces have two types of
/// values: absolute positions and relative distances.
///
/// Positions refer to points in space, such as timestamps or geographical coordinates. Distances represent a difference
/// between two such points.
///
/// Some natural languages acknowledge the distinction and offer different words for these concepts, such as oâ€™clock vs.
/// hours in English or Uhr vs. Stunden in German.
///
/// While distances behave the same way as `Amount`, positions are trickier. We can compare, order, and subtract them to
/// compute the distance between two points. For example, subtracting 5 am on Friday from 3 am on Saturday gives us
/// twenty-two hours. Adding or multiplying these dates makes no sense, however. This semantic demands a new class of
/// types, loci (plural of locus).
///
/// We can view each position as a distance from a fixed origin point. Changing the origin or the distance type calls for
/// a new locus type.
