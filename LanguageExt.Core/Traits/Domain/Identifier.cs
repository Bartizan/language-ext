/// One of the most common uses of domain types is a transparent handle for an entity or an asset in the real world,

/// identifiers.

/// Identifiers have no structure, i.e., we donâ€™t care about their internal representation. The only fundamental
/// requirement is the ability to compare values of those types for equality. This lack of structure suggests an
/// appropriate mathematical model for such types: a set, a collection of distinct objects.
