            I thought it would be novel to include the full article as the email newsletter.
            I don't really care about clicks or any of that nonsense and so this is another
            potential way to consume the article (that may even be more accessible for some)!
          </p>

            However, due to the way that email clients format and butcher HTML, the experience might not be as good. I have noticed that, on my iPhone, the code snippets get line-wrapped, making them pretty hard to decipher.  Still, I like the idea that if you've downloaded emails to your device, you can read the article offline, so I'm going to go with it for now. Feel free to let me know what you think.

            The formatting is much better there!
